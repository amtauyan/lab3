    <p><strong>Hobbies/Interests:</strong> I play games during my free time, but if I am lazy to move my fingers that much in such a game, I rather dance or like read books. Then, if there is a schedule for volleyball or badminton games made by my friends or family, I rather pick that than the other two hobbies.</p>
